Here is Cal Newport's Golden Rule of productivity says:
Deep work produced = time working * intensity of work

# Most time is not spent writing new code
Most time is spent debugging stuff
Most time is spent re-running experiments because you messed something up before
Optimize to avoid these mistakes
Check outputs frequently

# Setup and productivity

Block off time on your calendar for each task
Only listen to music if needed, preferably music without lyrics
Make sure you have water nearby
Log deep work hours on a calendar next to your desk
Don't check email or get distracted by minor things

# Coding-specific

When you're running lots of experiments, use IDs to label
do `import utils` instead of `from utils import train`
Using aliases

# Biggest time-wasters
Re-reading old email or slack conversations
Reading random blog posts online
Looking at online profiles/twitter accounts of other researchers
Looking at previous stuff that I wrote because it has cool formatting or I like the sound of my own writing
Applying to jobs/positions that you aren't super interested in
Close tabs that you aren't looking at
Admiring your LaTeX stuff

# Principles of research
Creativity
First-principles thinking
Intensity
Simplicity
Honesty
Depth of analysis
Long-term vision: Play the long game
