I graduated from Zhejiang University with B.A. in Automation (Robotics track). I like trying different things. Currently, I am struggling to surf in the beutiful beaches of La Jolla. 

I enjoyed basketball when I was a freshman and we nearly made the final (In freshman competition). I enjoy swimming, hiking and any other activities I could breath some fresh air and have fun. I like traveling, this land is just incredible. 

I grew up in a very warm family and I have a lovely girl friend. They give me strength to focus on research.
