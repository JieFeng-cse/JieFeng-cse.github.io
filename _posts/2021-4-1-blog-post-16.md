This past term at home passed by fast. I worked, but it feels like I didn't make too much progress.

Research
------
Alas, all of my pre-google submissions were accepted.
My paper on multi-task view text data augmentation was accepted to EACL, and my therapy conversations and few-shot text classification papers were accepted to NAACL. 
Having these papers accepted was a good start to my publication record and gave me some more confidence for submitting papers, especially after rejections from COLING and AACL. 

Applying to PhD Programs
------
I applied to PhD programs again, with low expectations. My low expectations were justified: I got rejected from Stanford, MIT, and UW. I was very excited, however, to have been accepted to ETHZ with Ryan Cotterell. I worked with Ryan on a psycholingistics project. He is very creative (approriately, Albert Einsten, who went to ETHZ, said "true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination"), and I would love to continue working with him. 


Fitness
------

**Weightlifting.** 
I started working on shoulders and triceps a bit in early january, but then one day I started getting a worrysome clicking sensation in my left shoulder, which I had had before. This stopped my progress for about a month, bringing me down from my 5x5 bench press from 170 lbs to 145 lbs.
I had a bad effect on my fitness thereafter, for which I did not really improve my bench press. In some highlights, however, I did do a murph in less than 55 minutes, and separately also did 250 pull ups in one hour with Abhishek.

**Tennis.** 
The one thing that I changed about tennis is that I tried to engage in *deliberate practice* by doing mostly drills during practice sessions. Some of the drills that I did included:
* Cross court on "yellow" balls, down the line on "green."
* Returner of feed must hit two forehands in a row.
* 99 bananas: 5 points for winners and points won at net, 10 for overheads. Minus 5 points for every shot hit into the net. Sounds stupid but teaches you not to hit it short.
I also tried to work on volleys and serves every practice.

Personal
------

**Learning Danish.** I kept up my Duolingo streak (161 days!). But, the lessons are getting hard, and I often have to look at the translations during the exercises.

**Making videos.** I recorded some videos of me playing tennis, such as this [warm-up session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQkIyhvvBY&list=PLde1z_HYAVJxIxzxx49lZQEknoGkbqyyK&index=3&t=557s&ab_channel=JasonWei) and this [drill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbrArNvGD9Y&list=PLde1z_HYAVJxIxzxx49lZQEknoGkbqyyK&index=4&t=1s).

I moved my working space to the upstairs sunroom in my house, which had really great lighting.

Reading
------

### *High Performance Habits* by Brendan Burchard
This may be the best self-help book I have ever read. I read it twice. In fact, I liked it so much that I bought a hardcover version of it, even though I already have it on kindle. 

### *The Institute* by Steven King
This is another paranormal thriller book by Steven King. It was pretty good (but not as good as *Misery*). The good thing was it was not too spooky, so I didn't get the willies as much before bed. 

I wanted to read *A Field Guide to Lucid Dreaming* in more depth but couldn't find the time. 


Who are my heroes?
------
- I guess Conan is funny. 
- My Google mentors are great. 


Closing
------
This term feels a bit like a failed attempt to seek clarity, both in my research directions and in my fitness. 


Songs
------
No new songs.


Youtubers
------
- bald and bankrupt, as always.
