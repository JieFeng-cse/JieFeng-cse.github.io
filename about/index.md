I am Jie Feng, a junior student form Zhejiang University. During the last four months, I served as a intern researcher in Tucodec, Shanghai, which is a prestigious IT company focusing on video compression. 

As video format information is getting more and more pervasive, video compression techniques are unprecedently needed in many fields including security, traffic, game industry, TV industry and internet video platforms. The reason is quite obvious that a faster and more powerful compression technique can significantly decrease the cost of information transmission and storage.

During the last several years, many efficient image compression techniques are proposed including jpeg and bpg. To date, more and more researchers utilize learning algorithms to gain better performance on this task. Some generative models including GAN, CAE and some super resolution models showed promising results. A CVPR workshop called CLIC ( short for challenge on learned image compression) is focusing on this subject and the annual challenge results show a stable progress in both compression speed and quality.  

Back to the topic, as a information format existing for more than 50 years, many compression techniques including H.264/H.265/H.266 and mpeg have proven their efficiency which can achieve impressive PSNR and MSSIM. Nevertheless, every coin has two sides, the time cost for those orthodox algorithms are often astonishing because of  . Compared with traditional methods, autoencoder based models accelerate the encoding and decoding process with a comparable or even better performance on PSNR and MS-SSIM. 

However, to my best knowledge, there is still not a comprehensive tutorial about video compression.  Based on my experience in Tucodec and the fundamental papers I read, I want to try my best to write a document to help people whoever interested in this direction to have a basic understanding of how learned  video compression algorithms works.

Besides, this web will also serve as a base for my other projects.
